We hand-out four projects during the term and we do not consider the worst project mark for your final course mark. Projects that you do not hand in are counted with a mark of 4.\n",

    "- **In contrast to the homework exercises, each student must hand in an own solution for the projects! Of course you can and should discuss problems with each other! However, you need to be able to explain your solution in detail to your tutor and/or the lecturers! We might ask you for an interview about your project if the solution is (close to) identical to another students submission.**\n",

These simulations should not challenge jupyterhub or python too much, but you should still consider how we can optimize performance as much as possible. Parallelization of the code is an option but not a requirement. Bottom line: If you pick this project, prepare, you might have a few minutes of run-time in the end. \n",

    "\n",
    "You might have noticed that for temperatures below the critical temperature, the energy often stagnates at some fixed value, where the system is not fully magnetized, but where flips are very rare. Often, the energy then has some stair-case-behavior where for a long time nothing happens and then suddenly a the energy drops. This is an effect of the system being stuck in a local minimum and then after a lucky flip escaping to find a state of even lower energy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Such dynamics can be very well studied by quenching the model: Starting at some fixed temperature, time-evolving until no transient dynamics are present, and then changing the temperature parameter suddenly and time-evolve the system again. As a final bonus exercise, you can try to quench your system: Start just above the critical temperature to have some larger domains developed. Allow some time evolution and then modify the temperature parameter to very low. Record the energy, and extract the size of energy steps (the difference between neighbouring energy points). How does the probability distribution of the energy differences look? Plot it with logarithmic y-axis. What happens if you apply a small magnetic field?\n",

    "The Ising model refers to a one-dimensional spin-model, but this system can of course be extended to for instance the XY-model, where the spins can take any direction in the plane. Such models can for instance be used to model flow of weather systems or water.
