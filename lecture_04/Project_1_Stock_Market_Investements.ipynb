    "## About the Projects\n",
    "- You will get one project approximately every other week.\n",
    "- Besides the homework-assignmentts, you need to solve the projects in order to pass the course. Your final course mark consists of the mean of your project marks. We aim to hand-out six projects during the term and we do not consider the worst project mark for your final course mark. Projects that you do not hand in are counted with a mark of 4.\n",
    "- The projects needs to be submitted by uploading a modified version of this notebook to [Projects/Project 1](https://ecampus.uni-bonn.de/goto_ecampus_exc_2645968.html) on eCampus. Your upload must be done by Wednesday, 11.05.2022, 23:59. **No late uploads can be accepted!**\n",
    "- **In contrast to the homework exercises, each student must hand in an own solution for the projects! Of course you can and should discuss problems with each other! However, you need to be able to explain your solution in detail to your tutor and/or the lecturers! We might ask you for an interview about your project if the solution is (close to) identical to another students submission.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** The tutors, Nina and I are very happy to help you out with difficulties you might have with the project tasks! You can ask questions any time but please do so well in advance of the deadlines!"

    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, we want to look at a long-term strategy to invest money in the stock market.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the stock market, we can invest into individual companies such as Apple, Sony, Deutsche Telekom, McDonalds etc. While investments in individual companies can result in very high profits if you pick the right ones, they also carry the risk of significant or even total losses - perhaps some of you remember WireCard (a once very famous German tech-company) which went bankrupt within a few days during 2020 (featured in this very well done [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivACzzW5wyA)). To minimise risks, a stock market portfolio should be broadly diversified over countries and indistrial sectors. An attractive option to realise this for private investors are so-called index funds. The so-called `MSCI-World` index allows you to invest with little money in $\\approx 1500$ large companies from 23 countries of the developed world. \n",
    "\n",
    "If we believe that the world economy steadily grows (it better does!), an investment in such an index has an expected return larger than 0 **in the long term**! We want to investigate in this notebook what time horizon an investment should have to not loose money."

Although the calculations for this case are a bit more complicated, you could do all of them with what you know already!

With a time-horizon of about 40 years until retirement and a lot of time for the compound interest effect to be effective, you could easily obtain a significant bonus for your retirement with only a moderate investment each month.
