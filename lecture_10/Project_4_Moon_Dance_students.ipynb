    "## About the Projects\n",
    "- You will get one project approximately every other week.\n",
    "- Besides the homework-assignments, you need to solve the projects in order to pass the course. Your final course mark consists of the mean of your project marks. We hand-out four projects during the term and we do not consider the worst project mark for your final course mark. Projects that you do not hand in are counted with a mark of 4.\n",
    "- The project needs to be submitted by uploading this notebook to [Projects/Project 4](https://ecampus.uni-bonn.de/goto_ecampus_exc_2645968.html) on eCampus. You do not need to modify the notebooks name before your upload. Your project must be on eCampus by Monday, 04.07.2022, 23:55. **No late uploads can be accepted!**\n",
    "- **In contrast to the homework exercises, each student must hand in an own solution for the projects! Of course you can and should discuss problems with each other! However, you need to be able to explain your solution in detail to your tutor and/or the lecturers! We might ask you for an interview about your project if the solution is (close to) identical to another students submission.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** The tutors, Nina and I are very happy to help you out with difficulties you might have with the project tasks! You can ask questions any time but please do so well in advance of the deadlines!"

    "Epimetheus and Janus are moons that orbit the planet Saturn; see also [this article on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epimetheus_(moon). Epimetheus's orbit is *co-orbitag with that of Janus*, i.e. they orbit Saturn on nearly equal trajectories. Janus's mean orbital radius from Saturn is only 50 km less than that of Epimetheus, a distance smaller than either moon's mean radius. All four years, the two moons meet each other as, according to Kepler's law, the inner moon moves a bit faster than the outer one. Your task is to investigate why there is no collision between the two moons.\n",
