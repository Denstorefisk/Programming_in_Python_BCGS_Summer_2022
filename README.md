# Programming in Python (BCGS; Summer 2022)
Materials for the course 'Programming in Physics and Astronomy with C++ or Python' (BCGS; Summer Term 2022)

## Goal of the course
The goal of the course is to teach physics/astronomy-students on the
master level how to efficiently and flexibly solve scientific
programming problems with the easy-to-learn, high-level programming
language Python. The course specifically addresses students with no
prior programming experience.

## Using the materials
You can either use the materials within an interactive Web-session
(see next section) or download them to your own machine. The latter option
is described [here](https://github.com/terben/Programming_in_Python_BCGS_Summer_2022/tree/master/retrieve_materials).
